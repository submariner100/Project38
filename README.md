# Project38 Core Data
Getting started with Core Data by building an app to fetch and store GitHub commits for Swift 
www.hackingwithswift.com - Project38
Lessons learnt - Setting initial UI, datamodel, writing code to set up the NSPersistantContainer and creating an method to save
any changes from memory back to the database on disk using the saveContext() and hasChanges methods. 
Creating an NSManagedObject subclass with xCode and NSFetchRequest().Using the ISO8601DateFormatter() method
Using SwiftyJSON to parse data from the gitHub API.
Making Core Data attribute unique using constraints
Using NSPredicate to filter NSFetchRequests
Adding Core Data entity relationships, lightweight vs heavyweight migrations
Deleting Core Data objects
Optimizing Core Data performance using NSFetchedResultsController.

I recommend this project to anyone thinking off learning Core Data. This project covers all the fundementals. This project also
throws up the dreaded swiftc failed with exit code 1. It took me nearly 5 hours to find out where the fault was using Apple docs and
StackoverFlow website, so a great project to learn and expand my theory on Swift.
